**Custom Printf Implementation written in C** ðŸŒŸ

A custom implementation of the standard **C printf** function, built from scratch to understand formatted output handling at a low level.

This project explores how variadic functions, format parsing, and buffer management work behind the scenes in C.

ðŸš€ Features

    Supports multiple format specifiers:
        %c - Character
        %s - String
        %d/%i - Signed integer
        %u - Unsigned integer
        %x/%X - Hexadecimal (lower/uppercase)
        %p - Pointer address
        %% - Percent sign
    Optimized conversion from decimal to hexadecimal using ASCII math.
    Memory-efficient and simple implementation.

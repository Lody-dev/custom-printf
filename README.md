Custom printf Implementation ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to my custom implementation of the printf function, created as part of my journey at 42 School! This project demonstrates my ability to handle low-level programming challenges, optimize code for efficiency, and apply foundational knowledge gained from earlier projects like Libft.

ðŸš€ Features

    Supports multiple format specifiers:
        %c - Character
        %s - String
        %d/%i - Signed integer
        %u - Unsigned integer
        %x/%X - Hexadecimal (lower/uppercase)
        %p - Pointer address
        %% - Percent sign
    Optimized conversion from decimal to hexadecimal using ASCII math.
    Memory-efficient and simple implementation.

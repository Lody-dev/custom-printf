42 Project - ft_printf

Objective

The goal of this project is to implement your own version of the printf function, named ft_printf. This project allows you to learn more about C's variable argument lists, formatting, and the inner workings of how output functions work in C.

Project Requirements
Your ft_printf function should behave like the standard printf in the C standard library, supporting basic and advanced formatting options for a variety of data types. You are required to handle the following specifiers and edge cases in the project:

Supported Format Specifiers:

%c: Print a single character.

%s: Print a string of characters.

%d / %i: Print a signed decimal integer.

%u: Print an unsigned decimal integer.

%%: Print a literal percent sign.
